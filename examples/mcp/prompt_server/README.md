# MCP Prompt Server Example

This repository example targets MCP Python SDK v2 and is intended to run with the repository's locked development environment. The Agents SDK client itself supports both MCP v1 and v2.

This example uses a local MCP prompt server in [server.py](server.py).

Run the example via:

```
uv run python examples/mcp/prompt_server/main.py
```

## Details

The example uses the `MCPServerStreamableHttp` class from `agents.mcp`. The script auto-selects an open localhost port (or honors `STREAMABLE_HTTP_PORT`) and runs the server at `http://<host>:<port>/mcp`, providing user-controlled prompts that generate agent instructions. If you need a specific address, set `STREAMABLE_HTTP_PORT` and `STREAMABLE_HTTP_HOST`.

The server exposes prompts like `generate_code_review_instructions` that take parameters such as focus area and programming language. The agent calls these prompts to dynamically generate its system instructions based on user-provided parameters.

## Workflow

The example demonstrates two key functions:

1. **`show_available_prompts`** - Lists all available prompts on the MCP server, showing users what prompts they can select from. This demonstrates the discovery aspect of MCP prompts.

2. **`demo_code_review`** - Shows the complete user-controlled prompt workflow:
   - Calls `generate_code_review_instructions` with specific parameters (focus: "security vulnerabilities", language: "python")
   - Uses the generated instructions to create an Agent with specialized code review capabilities
   - Runs the agent against vulnerable sample code (command injection via `os.system`)
   - The agent analyzes the code and provides security-focused feedback using available tools

This pattern allows users to dynamically configure agent behavior through MCP prompts rather than hardcoded instructions.
